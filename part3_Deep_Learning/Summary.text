Summary of Training and Evaluation Work for Image Classification Task
Objective
 - The objective of this task was to develop and train a deep learning model from scratch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different categories. The primary evaluation metric for this task is accuracy.

Data Preparation
 - Dataset: The CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
 - Data Augmentation: Applied standard transformations including resizing to 32x32 pixels, normalization with mean and standard deviation of 0.5 for each channel.
 - Loading Data: Utilized custom CIFAR10Dataset class to handle CSV files and image paths, ensuring labels are converted appropriately and invalid paths are handled.

Model Architecture
The model used is ImprovedCNN, a convolutional neural network designed with the following layers:
 - Convolutional Layers: Three convolutional layers with ReLU activations and max pooling.
 - Dropout Layers: Two dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
 - Fully Connected Layers: Two fully connected layers with ReLU activations.
 - Output Layer: A final fully connected layer with 10 output neurons corresponding to the 10 classes.

Training Process
 - Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss, suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
 - Optimizer: Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001.
 - Training Loop: Model was trained for 10 epochs, with loss computed and optimized in each batch iteration.
 - Evaluation During Training: Accuracy was evaluated after each epoch to monitor performance and make adjustments if necessary.

Results
 - Training Loss: Consistently decreased across epochs, indicating the model was learning effectively.
 - Accuracy:
    - Initial evaluation showed low accuracy due to incorrect label handling. This was rectified by ensuring labels and image paths were correctly processed and non-existent paths were filtered out.
    - Final evaluation demonstrated an improvement in accuracy, validating the model's ability to classify the CIFAR-10 images correctly.

Key Takeaways
 - Ensuring data integrity and proper preprocessing is crucial for model performance.
 - Dropout layers effectively reduce overfitting, leading to better generalization on the test set.
 - Continuous evaluation and debugging are necessary to identify and rectify issues such as incorrect label handling.
